/*
view
definition: 
A view encapsulates the result of a complex query and presents it as a virtial table
Instead of repeating long SQL statements, we can reuse the view in future queries as if it were a real table 
This help simplify complex SQL logic, improve readability, and centralize business rules in one place 


create view 
syntax:
create view view_name 
as
follow by complex select query;


modify view - two methods 
syntax:
1. 
create or replace view view_name
as
follow by complex select query;
2. 
alter view view_name
as
follow by complex select query;


delete view 
can delete one or more views at once 
it requires drop privileges, usually granted to the view owner or the root user
syntax:
drop view view1_nameï¼Œ view2_name.....;


view structure inspection - two method 
1.
desc view_name
2.
show create view view_name
